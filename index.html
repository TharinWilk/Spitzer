              <h4 class="htp-text-title">Trick Points</h4>
              <p>Each card has a number of points associated with its number or face. The suit does not change the point value of the cards. The following are the points given to each card:</p>
              <ul class="card-points">
                <li>Aces = 11</li>
                <li>Tens = 10</li>
                <li>Kings = 4</li>
                <li>Queens = 3</li>
                <li>Jacks = 2</li>
                <li>Nines, Eights, and sevens = 0</li>

              <h4 class="htp-text-title">Playing the Hand</h4>
              <p>The cards that are in a players hand, as well as the face up cards on the table, can be played. The cards that are face down on the table are added to a players hand when the face up card above them is played.</p>
              <p>When a fail card is led, all players must play that same suit if they have a fail card of the same suit, else the player may play trump.  When a trump card is led, all players must play trump if they have any.</p>
              <p>If player is out of trump when they are supposed to play trump card, they must play a fail card instead (fail cards of a different suit then the card led automatically lose reguardless of the cards value).</p>
              <p>Players then determine whose card is the highest (see chart in cards). The player that wins the trick leds the next card unless all cards have been played.</p>
              <p>If all cards have been played, the player with the highest total score wins the hand and is given the associated points seen in the Game Objectives section.</p>
